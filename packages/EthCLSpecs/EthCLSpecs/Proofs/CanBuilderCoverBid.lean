# `EthCLSpecs.Proofs.CanBuilderCoverBid`: Boolean characterization

`EthCLSpecs.Gloas.canBuilderCoverBid` is a pure `Bool` predicate used by
`processExecutionPayloadBid` before queuing a `BuilderPendingPayment`. This
file characterizes its result exactly using the `builderBalance` and
`minBalance` values computed by the implementation.

These are literal `UInt64` values; the theorem does not assert that accumulation
of pending obligations is overflow-free. Indexing is total, so the theorem also
holds for out-of-range `builderIndex` values, without claiming that the resulting
default value represents a registered builder.

Two theorems:

* `canBuilderCoverBid_iff`: the exact implementation-level characterization,
  `UInt64` throughout, guard and subtraction spelled exactly as the function
  computes them.
* `canBuilderCoverBid_iff_toNat_add_le`: a semantic characterization relative
  to that same computed `minBalance`, restated over `Nat` so the guard reads
  as a single addition-fits-in-balance fact rather than a subtraction.

See `EthCLSpecs/docs/CONSENSUS_PROOF_CANDIDATES.md`, "Bounds and termination
properties".

/-- `canBuilderCoverBid` returns `true` exactly when its computed `minBalance`
does not exceed the builder's balance and the bid fits in the remainder.

/-- Equivalent `Nat`-level characterization: `canBuilderCoverBid` accepts
exactly when the computed `minBalance` plus the bid fits within the builder's
balance. The addition in this conclusion cannot wrap; `minBalance` itself
remains the literal `UInt64` value produced by the implementation. -/
