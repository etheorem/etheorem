# `EthCLLib.PySpecTests.Interface`: the fork interface

The conformance contract is inverted (`SPEC_AUTHORING_MODEL.md` §11): the author
implements a fixed typeclass and `PySpecTests`, written once and fork-agnostic,
drives every format against it. This module defines that typeclass,
`ForkInterface`, and the per-case metadata the drivers read.

## The ByteArray boundary

A fork's container types are fork-specific, so the interface cannot name them
and stay fork-agnostic. It works at the **wire boundary** instead: every method
takes raw SSZ `ByteArray`s (a pre-state, a block, an operation) and returns a
post-state Merkle **root** as a `ByteArray`, or a typed reject. The fork decodes
through its own `SSZRepr`, runs the entry point on the boxed state, and takes the
root; the driver compares two roots, both `ByteArray`s, so it never names a fork
type. This is what lets the generic driver live in `EthCLLib` and depend on no
spec.

## Independently invocable entry points

A single-operation vector drives a single handler, so the operation and
epoch-substep methods take a **typed handler tag** (`OpKind` / `EpochStep`) and the
fork dispatches on it internally. The wire handler name from the case path (e.g.
`operations/proposer_slashing` → `"proposer_slashing"`) is parsed to its tag once, at
the driver boundary (`OpKind.ofString?` / `EpochStep.ofString?`); an unrecognized name
is out of scope. This keeps the method set fixed while still driving one handler in
isolation, the inverted contract's requirement.

## One method per format family, dispatched on a typed tag

The docs list "the individual `process_*` steps" as separate entry points. A
typeclass with ~40 methods is unwieldy, so the interface exposes one method per
*format family* (`runOperation`, `runEpochSubstep`) taking the handler axis as an
inductive tag rather than one method per step. The tag keeps the contract on the
typechecker (`SPEC_AUTHORING_MODEL.md` §11): a fork's `runOperation` / `runEpochSubstep`
matches the tag exhaustively, so omitting a handler is a compile error and adding a
handler for a later fork forces every fork to route or explicitly defer it. A handler
the fork does not drive maps to an explicit `todo` arm, not a silent `_`, so the
deferral is visible on the page. Each handler stays independently invocable.

/-- The runner's per-step valid/invalid check for a fork-choice step, fork-agnostic over
the store type `σ`. `expectedValid` is the step's wire flag; `outcome` the result of
running the step, carrying the error-time store on a reject (`runOn`).

The step itself never decides pass/fail; this does. A step expected valid that succeeds
threads its new store. One expected invalid that is rejected continues FROM THE
ERROR-TIME STORE: the reference pyspec runner mutates in place and catches the raise, so
mutations made before the reject (e.g. `on_attestation`'s target-checkpoint cache insert
before the signature assert) persist there, and the handlers `set` at pyspec mutation
points to reproduce exactly that. The two mismatches, a valid step that is rejected and
an invalid step that is accepted, are failures: the first returns the step's own error,
the second a typed mismatch.

Which rejects count as the expected rejection is `StoreTransitionError.isExpectedRejection`
(`Spec/Errors.lean`), the one home for that policy: the reference runner (`context.py`'s
`expect_assertion_error`) catches `AssertionError` and `IndexError`, so exactly `.assert` and
`.transition (.outOfBounds …)` (the store machine's only index-miss shape, since
`StoreTransitionError` has no bare `.outOfBounds`), bare and `.transition`-wrapped, thread the
error-time store as faithful expected rejections. Everything else propagates as `.error`:
`.todo` / `.outOfScope` (bare or wrapped) are our own deferral, reported xfail / skip at the
server, and `.missingKey` or any other unexpected store error, which the reference does not
catch and `classify` treats as a likely bug, now fails the step rather than passing it. -/

step with a `<label> decode failed` `decodeFailure` reject paired with `before` (nothing ran,
so the error-time store is the pre-step store). That reject is a decoder / container bug, NOT
an expected rejection: fork-choice vectors are always well-formed, so a parse miss here is our
bug, and modeling it as `.assert` would let a `valid:false` step falsely PASS on a broken
decoder. `label` names the wire type in that message; `f` runs the handler over the decoded
